 identical to the 'improved' version of the mc2RSW model (DOI: 10.1002/qj.3292)
 without any moist convection.

 run twolayer_fplane.py on command line to generate an animation.  
 needs mkl_fft or pyfftw and matplotlib with qt5agg backend.,
 
 twolayer_sphere.py is the spherical geometry version (requires shtns).
