identical to the 'improved' version of the mc2RSW model (DOI: 10.1002/qj.3292)
without any moist convection.

run twolayer.py on command line to generate an animation.  
needs pyfftw and matplotlib with qt5agg backend for animation.
 
twolayer_sphere.py is the spherical geometry version (requires shtns).
